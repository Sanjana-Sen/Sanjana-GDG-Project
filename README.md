"Planning with the Gemini API" - a Firebase AI sample app
Welcome to the Planning with the Gemini API sample app, an AI-powered web app for to-do lists! It's an Angular app built using the Gemini API and Firebase.

The Gemini API gives you access to Google's latest generative AI models – the Gemini family of multimodal models. This Planning with the Gemini API web app calls the Gemini API to generate a task list from either text or an image provided by the end user.

The backend of Planning with the Gemini API is powered by Firebase, which is Google's platform for building fullstack multi-platform apps. This app uses Firebase Authentication for signing-in and authorizing end users. It also uses Firestore – a NoSQL realtime database – to store the to-do list items.
